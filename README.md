# Google-Sans-Clock
> ##### A simple, yet useful full screen JavaScript clock
**To try out the clock just the way it is, you can use the [repo's GitHub Pages site](https://ethanhsuhsu.github.io/Google-Sans-Clock)**
> The clock is built using a combination of basic HTML, CSS and Javascript code. Since the source is small enough, all of the clock's contents are stored in a [index.html](index.html) file.



###### Even though the clock is only 50 lines of code, here is what it includes out-of-the-box:
* A connection with Javascript's Date global object that syncs with near-second accuracy
* The display with the hours, minutes and seconds updated with the connection
* 12-Hour-Time Formating, the addition of delimeter colons and spacing 0's
* An auto-sizing text mechanism that adjusts to the window width
* Colorful red, yellow, green & blue backgrouns and text colors which adjust every minute

_Luckily, this project is open-source and unlicensed. So feel free to add more functionality to the clock to make it your own!_
